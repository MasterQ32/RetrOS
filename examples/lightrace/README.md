# Light Race

This is a small game known as *Light Race*, which is similar to
the classic game Snake or Nibbles.

Control the moving line with the arrow keys over the screen and
try to evade yourself and the screen edges.

If you hit a non-background pixel, the game is over and a
game over screen is shown.

## Background

This is the first game written in the GASM language and running
on the ZGS.

The program was actually used to design the GASM language by
creating a *real world* use case and modelling a pleasant
coding experience with that.
